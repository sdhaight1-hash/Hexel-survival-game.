# Documentation map and source-of-truth guide

**Scope:** Hexel Survival Game repository. This index distinguishes
**art direction**, **architecture contracts**, **implementation records**,
**active roadmaps** and **historical experiments**. It does not declare
any feature complete that the runtime cannot demonstrate.

## Read in this order

1. [Project README](../README.md) for the actual playable demo, controls
   and build/test commands.
2. [Canonical style guide](../assets/STYLE_GUIDE.md) **only for visual
   direction and art approval**: palette, material identity, silhouettes,
   atmosphere and gameplay-readable presentation.
3. [Architecture/ownership](integration.md) and
   [world design](world-generation.md) for global-local boundaries,
   coordinates, finite resources and long-term planned systems.
4. The *specific* design or milestone document below for the task.
5. [Contribution and visual QA](visual-contribution-guide.md) and
   [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the implementation/review workflow.

Do not substitute an older milestone report for current runtime behavior.
Code, registry records and validated current CI are the evidence of
implementation; the project owner approves art and deliberate design changes.

## Illustrated documentation

- [Original art-direction posters](../assets/style-infographics/README.md):
  visual identity and geology remain in the style guide; the flora
  architecture poster now appears in vegetation design.
- [Editable technical infographics](../assets/diagrams/README.md):
  material/overlay composition, optional SCA consumers, finite-water
  conservation, and world generation with persistent edits.

These are **illustrative diagrams**. The canonical prose and tested
implementation determine actual contracts, quality and shipping status.

## Classification and status discipline

- **Decided:** project direction or invariant agreed, not necessarily coded.
- **Implemented prototype:** verified, scoped runnable/headless feature;
  does not imply full production pipeline, persistence or acceptance.
- **Candidate:** visually or technically proposed, not approved.
- **Planned / research:** unimplemented; experiments still required.
- **Historical:** preserved design context. It cannot override a newer
  verified specification or current code.

**Current runtime snapshot (2026-11-04):** the default bounded one-chunk
P0 gallery and its BC7 fallback coexist with the opt-in deterministic,
moving **95-section streamed world**. The v2 catalog/BC7 baker/index
validator, F8 candidate gallery, F9/F10 diagnostic surfaces, F1 clickable
menu, F2 copyable console and F3 frame/render CPU diagnostics exist.
`Is_Moving` and `Is_Looking` partition samples; opt-in presentation
mode/latency launch flags support native A/B tests. These are engineering
prototypes, not finished world-scale streaming or validated GPU timings.
Three source art records remain `candidate`, 52 are `needs_art`,
and **zero are `approved`**. There is no general v2 production
material binding, persistent world edit/ore/cover system, living flora,
finite-water solver, active toroidal wrap or distant LOD.

**SCA status:** the [bounded headless prototype](../src/space_colonization.rs),
[space-colonization study](space-colonization-study.md) and
[finite-water study](finite-water-spatial-growth-study.md) are now in
`main`, merged via [PR #30](https://github.com/sdhaight1-hash/Hexel-survival-game/pull/30). None is a
production flora/ore/cave/water generator. The planned P2.3 overlay
mask system does not depend on SCA.

## Documentation lifecycle

- **Canonical art:** edit the style guide only when artistic standards
  change. Technical implementations must not quietly redefine the look.
- **Architecture:** record types, inputs, outputs, ownership, constraints,
  precision/seam issues and validation criteria in the relevant design
  document. Avoid copying the full art direction into it.
- **Status and work:** update the two roadmaps and the relevant milestone
  note when code changes; preserve unpassed native visual gates.
- **History:** first-person 32px experiment and the early material-format
  draft remain for context, clearly labeled and linking to the current
  source of truth. Do not use their old settings as current instructions.
- **Other repositories:** Voxel Game Engine and Hexel Game Engine are
  reference implementations, not dependencies or sources of game-state
  authority. Their docs must not be assumed to match this runtime.

The [repository audit and branch disposition report](repository-audit-2026-11-04.md)
records which remote branches contain unique historical/experimental work,
which documents were stale, and what remains blocked by Windows-native QA.
Treat that report as a dated snapshot, not a replacement for this index.

The [master art epic #14](https://github.com/sdhaight1-hash/Hexel-survival-game/issues/14)
tracks P0–P7 tasks. The [main roadmap](roadmap.md) tracks M0–M3.
Neither supersedes this index or the style guide's art-review criteria.
