# Texture, material and overlay roadmap — revised after P2.2

**Status:** planning revision, 2026-11-03. This document reconciles phase
gates with [master art epic #14](https://github.com/sdhaight1-hash/Hexel-survival-game/issues/14); existing
technical specifications and the [canonical style guide](../assets/STYLE_GUIDE.md) still govern implementation and visual approval.
Do not read an unchecked future feature as shipping functionality.

## Decision

Keep **three distinct layers** of responsibility:

1. **Authored material identity:** stable IDs, face-appropriate tileable
   base/color/normal/roughness inputs as supported, physical repeat in
   metres, BC7 source baking and suitable GPU bindings. A granite surface
   remains granite independently of overlays.
2. **Feature/condition coverage:** a continuous spatial or surface mask,
   derived either from deterministic region-scale geometry (ore vein,
   fracture, root), authored decal/patch placement, or authoritative
   environment state (wetness, frost, moss and disturbance). These
   mechanisms are complementary, not all required for every material.
3. **Material response/compositing:** host remains visible; ore species,
   coverage/grade, seasonal cover and surface conditions modulate albedo,
   roughness/metallic response or geometry as appropriate. Render output
   **never establishes** mineable quantity, water, ecology, ore location
   or persistent edits.

**Space colonization is an optional source of connected geometry, not a
texture format, material editor, overlay compositor, or prerequisite for
the general texture system.** Its bounded headless Rust graph is now in
[src/space_colonization.rs](../src/space_colonization.rs), merged via
[PR #30](https://github.com/sdhaight1-hash/Hexel-survival-game/pull/30). The initial code creates parent-linked segments only; it
does not generate an actual mineral deposit, shader mask or cave system.

The new architecture supports a *single* region-owned ore/fracture
structure appearing across adjacent faces without per-hexel randomly
restarting its pattern. A tileable rock texture supplies fine material
identity underneath. Pattern geometry should be **feature-local or
world-anchored**, converted to chunk-local coordinates for renderer
precision; the proposed toroidal hex-lattice seam mapping is still
unresolved.

## Verified status from current `main`

| Track | Code / assets delivered | Remaining acceptance and production work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 — test board | Bounded 16³ first-person demo; eight hex-prism faces with physically scaled UV; F6/F7 debug checks; original reference gallery; build-time 12-layer BC7 with RGBA fallback | Visual taste/QA and native GPU checks; P0 is not approved final art |
| P1 — format/baking | `catalog.v2.json` inventories 55 IDs; independent PNG RGBA8/BC7 baker, validator, index/cache validation; narrow optional F8 test gallery | General runtime v2 GPU material binding, grouped variable-dimension/mip strategy, broader face recipes and approved sources |
| P2 reference materials | Three registered candidates: granite, shale, native copper overlay; all 256² art revised in P2.1 | Source candidates need player-scale approval; soil/grass authored reference, first living flora visuals, grade fixtures and full P2 slice absent |
| P2.2 reactive surfaces | F8+F9 gallery supports wet, moss/lichen, frost, mixed presets; F10 controls localized copper sheen/glints; overlap hides glints beneath coverage | Simulated/persisted condition inputs, cross-face structural masks, true decal/marks, other materials and artist approval absent |
| P3 — 55 geology identities | All 55 **inventoried** (5 soils, 1 forest-floor cover, 23 rocks, 16 ore, 10 minerals) | 52 `needs_art`; 3 `candidate`; **0 approved**; not a finished replacement library |
| P4/P5 vegetation | Typed flora/cover concepts, research registry and authoring references | No production flora asset binding, accepted species assets, growth stages, streaming/harvest integration |
| P6 — ecology/weather overlays | Gallery-only F9 diagnostic values | No world-driven state, snow/ice accumulation, weather, growth, persisted surface damage or decals |
| P7 — optimization | Measured P0 BC7 memory reduction from 3.00 MiB RGBA to 0.75 MiB BC7 for 12 × 256² layers; BC7 fallback and tests | Mipmaps, general texture packing, streaming, scalable overlays, foliage alpha performance and target-machine measurement |

The P0 gallery is real, while its art is still provisional. The P1
authoring/baker work is functional, **not fully integrated into the
production renderer**. The P2.1/P2.2 art and effect demos need native
visual acceptance. Do not reimplement P0 or P1; extend and validate.

- **Base materials:** high-quality tileable or appropriately projected
  authored rock/soil/wood textures. They do not need SCA.
- **Embedded geological patterns:** geology chooses ore-bearing volume,
  host compatibility, grade and resource identity. A vein/stockwork may
  use SCA *or* a simpler fault, spline, sheet or noise structure.
  Project or sample the **same** bounded 3D feature onto exposed caps
  and all six side orientations; suppress mineral when the authoritative
  host/occurrence is absent.
- **Cover and reactive conditions:** wetness, frost and thin moss can
  start as deterministic bounded masks/material parameters; thick snow,
  vegetation, long roots and actual holes require owned geometry/state.
  Don't grow thousands of procedural SCA networks just to paint wetness.
- **Localized marks:** erosion patterns, cracks, soot, footprints and
  mining scuffs may use small decals or sparse projected masks. The
  game saves edits and their semantic origin; caches remain disposable.
- **Rendering:** only selected metallic minerals get view/light-dependent
  metal response; preserve host, readable grade cues and low-specular
  alternatives. Covers can hide exposed ore highlights without
  changing subsurface ore quantity.

A seam-free feature need not be an extra full-resolution overlay PNG
per hexel. Prefer small shared mask/detail assets and bounded world-space
data when equivalent, measure shader samples/feature lookup and texture
residency, and fall back to baked region masks or mesh where appropriate.
Do not prescribe a universal shader, new attachment format or texture
channel reservation before a tested vertical slice exists. The F8
candidate copper alpha currently doubles as a preview mask, **not** a
universal production packing contract.

**Visual overview:** the [material + overlay composition diagram](../assets/diagrams/material-overlay-stack.svg) summarizes the
design contract. The overlay-path proof and the optional SCA adapter
remain **future gates**, not working production components.

**Evidence baseline:** the [industry research study](material-variation-industry-research.md) compares official Hytale tint providers, Vintage Story's climate/season colormaps, Eco's ecological authority and material/foliage techniques from Unreal, Unity/SpeedTree, Godot, Mojang, and graphics research. It distinguishes verified shipped mechanisms from draft Hexal proposals; **do not** interpret those precedents as approval of our live shader architecture.

## Proposed variation model (pending visual/technical proof)

The recent material study boards compared five visual variations for
low-fertility soil/grass, granite, shale, native copper and wet/moss/
frost/mixed conditions. **These were concept comparisons**, not five
approved production PNGs per material. Explore **curated families**
rather than authoring every colored combination.

Prefer **shared grayscale masks / tonal patterns with shader-driven
mineral-specific palettes** where it reduces content duplication
without making different ores indistinguishable. The new palette
should include color distribution and appropriate surface response,
not one universal flat tint. Reserve dedicated colored assets for
species/host appearances that require them. Pair a pattern family
with deterministic geology/region-aware selection; the same pattern
must not randomly change on each chunk rebuild.

**This is a candidate extension, not implemented P1/P2.** Do not
commit a five-variants-per-identity requirement, a schema revision,
BC4, atlas, new GPU array architecture or a full palette renderer
until one small art/CPU/GPU proof passes. The present v2 catalog,
baker and F8/F9/F10 preview are intentionally unchanged.

**Add to Gate A:** evaluate the existing copper full-color baseline
against a grayscale coverage+detail mask with at least one
mineral-specific multi-stop color ramp, and reject designs that
erase rock/ore identity. Use the five-option boards as choices,
not mandatory production source files.

**Add to Gate B:** after the general v2 stable-ID binding, test
three-to-five curated grayscale members as a **family** in one
bounded fixture, explicit face recipes, fallback, stable IDs,
versioned manifest and deterministic weights. Test raw texture
bytes, GPU residency and sample count; do not assume BC4 support.

**Add to Gate C:** let a region-owned **continuous ore feature mask**
determine coverage while grayscale tiles supply internal detail;
sample the same field on neighboring caps/sides. Validate no ore
outside eligible hosts, no per-hexel reseeding and no stock inferred
from colors. Keep the simple fault/spline source as the baseline;
optional SCA remains Gate D.

**Approval:** one source pattern may be compatible with multiple
ore species, but a material family must have enough unique shape,
value, finish and oxidation cues to meet the
[style guide](../assets/STYLE_GUIDE.md). If two ores read as mere
recolors at 3m, the abstraction fails even if it saves memory.
See [the proposed authoring contract](material-authoring-contract.md)
and [overlay composition design](overlay-visual-architecture.md).

**Cross-material extension:** grayscale detail/palette families
are an option for rocks, non-ore minerals, bark, leaves, grass,
soil and thin organic/seasonal cover—not only embedded ore. Reuse
compatible textures, but **do not** automatically replace unique
stone strata, bark growth direction, foliage geometry/silhouette
and species pigmentation with a shared recolored bitmap. Internal
leaf detail, leaf **cutout alpha** and exposed ore coverage are
different fields with different shader/geometry responsibilities.

**Extended proof after the copper baseline:** A/B-test (a) two
granite/shale base variants against their original authored color,
(b) two species-specific bark recipes on suitable trunk/branch
geometry, and (c) one leaf silhouette with two seasonal color
ramps, independently of actual season simulation. Preserve source
and gameplay identity and test coherent clustering, correct
orientation, color in linear space, texture residency, shader
samples, alpha mips and recognition at player scale. Keep these
as small independent fixtures; do not postpone P2.3 copper/vein
continuity for a complete flora system.

**Fantasy palette/phenotype acceptance:** include a small tree
visual study alongside the grayscale-family prototype: one
blue-leaf weeping-willow variant on a consistent willow geometry;
one ordinary-to-autumn broadleaf palette change; and distinct
winter-bare versus snow-covered branch treatments. These are
art/asset experiments, not new world-biome systems. A fantasy ore
or metal may share compatible grayscale morphology but requires
its own palette, roughness/metallic/emissive rules and, if gameplay
properties differ, authoritative material ID. Evaluate silhouettes,
readability in neutral light, and whether rare fantasy colors
remain harmonious with the style guide. Do **not** turn snow into
a white leaf tint or assume blue foliage is automatically luminous.

**Time-driven seasonal palette study (additional P4/P5 visual gate):**
extend the proposed family-palette proof with an ordered cyclic
array of approved spring/summer/autumn/winter (or species-specific)
color ramps. Interpolate between adjacent keyframes based on
**authoritative game-year phase** and eventual regional phenology,
without rebaking full-color foliage textures or changing a plant
species/material ID. Keep interpolation space explicit (linear
light baseline), handle year wrap and deterministic world-time
jumps, and do not presume every region shares four Earth seasons.

For one deciduous broadleaf, one evergreen and one fantasy-blue
willow, compare fixed keyframes and a smooth full-year sweep.
Independently test *leaf retention* and *snow/frost cover* rather
than using color shifts to fake either. Record 1m/3m/8m visuals,
silhouette, color gradient, LOD/mip behavior and shader cost.
This belongs alongside first flora-asset bindings (#13), not
inside the already-working F8 copper/material gallery. A
prototype may use a synthetic time slider; **no planetary
time/climate implementation is implied**. Don't expand the
existing v2 catalog or shader contract before this visual proof.


## Revised dependencies and phase gates

The historic **P0–P7 labels remain as milestones** for issue/PR continuity,
but tasks now have explicit prerequisites rather than pretending the
whole art library must ship before any overlay work.

### Gate A — close visual reference review (P0 / P2.1 / P2.2)

**Already delivered:** P0 board, BC7, F8 source revisions, F9/F10
reactive demonstration.

**Next:** capture native same-camera 1m/3m/8m neutral-light and
shadow comparisons of bare granite, shale and copper on both; inspect
cap/side joins, six sides, shimmer, glint locality, moss/frost occlusion.
Get user art-direction approval **or revise the three candidates**.
Document evidence; tests cannot approve visual style.

### Gate B — finish reusable runtime material plumbing (remaining P1)

Make the real v2 material index and stable face/overlay IDs selectable
through a narrow runtime path with a P0 fallback. Test independently
sized source materials, physical repeat, invalid/missing packs,
BC7 support/fallback, correct hex-face roles, and unchanged authoritative
terrain IDs. Avoid making a complete platform texture streamer before
the small reference slice works.

**Exit:** an authored candidate/approved material selected by stable
ID reaches a real face in the gallery without hardcoded special-case
rock IDs. P0 remains available as fallback.

### Gate C — independent overlay compositor and world-space continuity (new P2.3)

Implement **one minimal feature-mask interface/fixture** for a known
world-space line or small synthetic region deposit across neighboring
hexel caps/sides, plus a separate scalar wetness or thin cover mask.
The host/mask/condition identities remain independent. Sample stable
world/feature coordinates, not per-cell random UV restarts. Test
tile/chunk request order, side-to-cap joins, outside-host suppression,
mask ordering/occlusion and P0 fallback.

**Exit:** moving the camera or rebuilding neighboring meshes does not
shift/reseed a connected visible pattern; no extra ore is fabricated.
Use one host/ore/condition fixture, not all 55 materials.

### Gate D — optional SCA-to-overlay adapter proof (new P2.4 / SC-1)

On a bounded preselected geological fixture, run the existing
research SCA graph **only if suitable**, assign feature ID and
geological eligibility, derive radius/width and cross-face mask from
its edges. Compare a non-SCA spline/fault baseline with the same
constraints at near/medium/distance views. Require no botanical-looking
veins, correct poor/medium/rich readability and localized metallic
response, deterministic region/chunk clipping and no hidden ore exposure.
Depletion is not inferred from alpha.

**Exit:** ship the specialized feature source **only if it outperforms**
the simpler baseline visually or structurally within measured CPU/GPU
budgets. The entire material/overlay system must work without this
adapter; integrating SCA into the production overlay system still requires
separate validation and approval.

### Gate E — game-state handoff and edit persistence (P2 production / M1–M3)

Replace diagnostic F9 condition values with **actual** persisted or
derived wetness/cover/damage inputs incrementally. Link ore visual
coverage to actual saved ore occurrences and depleted state; test mining,
newly exposed faces, unload/reload, and deterministic feature ownership.
Actual finite water, climate, moss ecology and geological worldgen may
be absent initially: use explicit saved fixtures, never imply a
simulated planet. Scope edits to state contracts, not massive engine
rewrites.

### Gate F — complete material and flora art (P3 / P4 / P5)

After the reference family passes, build remaining **52 unapproved**
source identities deliberately, with host-specific patterns and
nonmetallic mineral responses. Build soil/cover variants and first
grass/tree/fungus authoring-to-runtime fixtures. Grow the approved flora
roster from the 208 **research** rows only after selection; don't
manufacture 208 production assets. Preserve reusable textures/geometry
and staged growth or harvest state.

### Gate G — real environmental/impact overlay coverage (P6)

Author separate snow/frost accumulation, wetness, lichen, ash/soot,
wear/tracks/damage and seasonal effects, with priority/masking,
decals or geometry where justified. Let weather, ecology, finite water
and player actions provide the *authoritative* values as those systems
arrive. No dependency on SCA for ordinary reactive coverage.

### Gate H — optimization and quality closure (P7)

Benchmark mipmaps/alpha coverage, BC7 packs, format fallback,
asset grouping, shader sample cost, world-space feature lookups,
decals/geometry batching, streaming stability and shader LOD.
Use representative busy scenes and actual hardware frametimes, not
texture-compression percentages as FPS claims. Maintain visually
equivalent ore and hazard readability at all quality tiers.

## First next implementation slice

**Prefer Gate A and Gate C planning together, then Gate B/C as narrow
implementation milestones.** The immediate visual risk is unapproved
rock/copper art; the immediate architectural risk is building a
per-hexel fixed-mask pipeline that cannot represent connected features.
Don't expand to 55 source artworks until we have at least one
approved-quality reference and one stable cross-face mask path.

An inexpensive initial comparison should show **the same** granite
with (i) existing tiled copper alpha, (ii) a world-space continuous
copper vein driven by a fixed graph/spline, and (iii) no ore, across two
or more neighboring hexels and different face angles. Evaluate at
1m/3m/8m and in motion. Add the SCA generator as a separate measured
candidate *after* this plumbing proves useful.

**Not this revision:** no engine/shader code, new material statuses,
water solver, global geology, flora production, image assets, or
production SCA-to-overlay integration.
